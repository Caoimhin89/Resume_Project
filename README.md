This project was undertaken as a part of the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree.

To complete this project I used JavaScript to populate an HTML resume template with my own data. In doing so, I learned how to write properly formatted JSON to interchange data, improved my command of jQuery to manipulate DOM elements according to my own design preferences, and learned proper JavaScript syntax and how to simplify my code by means of encapsulation.
